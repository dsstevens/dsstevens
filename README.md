## 👋 Hi, I’m Deanna  👩‍💻🐈‍⬛📚
👀 I’m interested in open source projects, accessibility in tech, and perpetually focused on human-centered design.

💾  I’m currently working freelance, focusing on e-commerce sites for small businesses and as a Business Systems Analyst with the University System of Georgia.

🌎 I love traveling, cooking for friends, and gardening. Ask me about my chaos garden!
